== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I add two audio files (ogg and mp3) to each track? =

Because of browsers compatibility. Some browsers support mp3 files, while others support ogg. 
Providing both you make sure that the track will be played in almost any browser. 
<a title="developer.mozilla.org" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Build/Audio_and_video_delivery/Cross-browser_audio_basics#Audio_Codec_Support" target="_blank">Here</a> 
you can see the audio codec support for each browser.

= So, does this plugin work with any browser? =

No (but almost). It will work only with HTML5 audio compatible browsers. <a title="caniuse.com" href="http://caniuse.com/#search=audio element" target="_blank">Here</a> you can see a list of supported browsers.

= The widget does not appear in the "widgets" section =

Reload the page. If the widget "Dynamic Audio Player Widget" is not added to the sidebar, add it manually.
